# Comparison of Different Schedulers

Comparison of different schedulers as used for example at StableDiffusion

## Different schedulers.py

This file can be used to investigate different schedulers
with different promts. An image is generated and the time is measured.

## Different timesteps.py

This file can be used to investigate different schedulers
with different timesteps. This is done by trying different numbers
for timesteps, measuring the time and generating an image for each number
of timesteps.

## Own inference pipeline.py

Here a custom inference pipeline is created.
Many parameters can be changed here.
